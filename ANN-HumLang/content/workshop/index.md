### Workshop (10-12 June, 2024)
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have proven to be powerful learning devices for language-related tasks, as demonstrated by recent progress in artificial intelligence driven by large, Transformer-based language models. But how can ANNs inform us about _human_ language learning and processing? Our three-day workshop brings together researchers working on cognitively motivated and linguistic questions in studying the language processing mechanisms and learning trajectories of ANNs. 

For the first two days of the programme, we hope to stimulate discussion on the workshop theme through contributed presentations from our workshop participants and keynote speakers. The final day is focussed on active interactions and collaboration between participants, through small-scale tutorials and joint group work on a collaborative task. See our provisional [programme](#programme) below for more information and currently confirmed participants!

#### Registration
Registration is now open until **May 24th**! Please {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://forms.gle/6yn1ZRv7jf6pAVyE6"><button><b>register here</b></button></a>{{< /rawhtml >}} if you are interested in attending. Participation in the workshop is free of charge but the number of participants is limited. Priority will be given to junior researchers (PhD students and postdocs) and researchers who take part in the poster session and the collaborative task if we need to limit the number of attendees.

{{< details "_Can modern Language Models be truly polyglot? Language learnability and inequalities in NLP_" >}}
Despite their impressive advances, modern Language Models (LMs) are still far from reaching language equality, i.e. comparable performance in all languages.
The uneven amount of data available in different languages is often recognized as the main culprit. However, another obstacle to language equality is posed by the observation that some languages are intrinsically more difficult to model than others by modern LM architectures, even when training data size is controlled for.

In this talk, I will present evidence supporting this observation, coming from different tasks and different evaluation methodologies (e.g. using natural versus synthetic languages).
I will then argue for the usefulness of artificial languages to unravel the complex interplay between language properties and learnability by neural networks.
Finally, I will provide an outlook of my upcoming project aimed at improving language modeling for (low-resource) morphologically rich languages, taking inspiration from child language acquisition.

{{< details "_What neural networks can teach us about how we learn language_" >}}
How can modern neural networks like large language models be useful to the field of language acquisition, and more broadly cognitive science, if they are not a priori designed to be cognitive models? As developments towards natural language understanding and generation have improved leaps and bounds, with models like GPT-4, the question of how they can inform our understanding of human language acquisition has re-emerged. This talk address how AI models as objects of study can indeed be useful tools for understanding how humans learn language. It will present three approaches for studying human learning behaviour using different types of neural networks and experimental designs, each illustrated through a specific case study. 

Understanding how humans learn is an important problem for cognitive science and a window into how our minds work. Additionally, human learning is in many ways the most efficient and effective algorithm there is for learning language; understanding how humans learn can help us design better AI models in the future.

[Ethan Wilcox](https://wilcoxeg.github.io/) (ETH Zürich)  
{{< details "_Using artificial neural networks to study human language processing: Two case studies and a warning_" >}}  
Neural network language models are pure prediction engines, they have no communicative intent, and they do not learn language through social interactions. Despite this, I argue that they can be used to study human language processing, in particular, to empirically evaluate theories that are based on probability distributions over words. In the first half of this talk, I discuss two case studies in this vein, focusing on psycholinguistic theories of incremental processing, as well as regressions, or backward saccades between words. In the second half of the talk, I take a step back and discuss the impact of scaling for the usefulness of ANNs in psycholinguistics research. Scaling is the trend toward producing ever-larger models, both in terms of parameter counts and in terms of the amount of data they are trained on. While largely beneficial to performance on downstream benchmarking tasks, scaling has several downsides for computational psycholinguistics. I will discuss the scientific and practical challenges presented by scaling for neural network modeling, as well as the benefits that would result from human-scale language modeling research.
